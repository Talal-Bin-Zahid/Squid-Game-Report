🔍 Key Insights

Twitter activity experienced a massive spike in early October, peaking at over 10K tweets, indicating heightened interest shortly after release.

Engagement gradually declined but showed secondary peaks around October 17, suggesting renewed discussion or related events.

Most tweets fall within the 100–150 character range, with a peak of 19.2K tweets, reflecting concise engagement rather than long-form commentary.

Influential media accounts such as Zee News English, Hindustan Times, and The Tonight Show played a major role in amplifying reach.

Mobile platforms dominate tweet sources, with iPhone and Android accounting for the majority of activity.
